        At Alabama Kidnastics, we understand that children have a lot of interests and activities these days.  
        Therefore we are one of the few facilities that offer our classes on a month-to-month basis rather than forcing parents into a long-term commitment. 
        We're pleased to be able to offer these more realistic options for your children!

          An alumnus of the University of Georgia, Beth has been a gymnastics instructor for over 37years.  
          Beth has operated gymnastics facilities for more than 20 years, 
          the largest being the Cobb County Georgia Parks and Recreation gymnastics facility and its programs with over 750 kids enrolled. She has also taught Health and PE in the Georgia and 
          Texas public school systems for a total of 9 years.
          In 2003, after she and her family moved to Huntsville, Beth opened Ryland Pike Gymnastics in space that 
          was leased from the Southern Sass Dance Studios. In 2008, to meet the continued growth of her enrollment, 
          she decided to move the program into its own facilities on Winchester Road where she renamed the facility Alabama Kidnastics. We began with one suite and now have expanded to 5 suites.
